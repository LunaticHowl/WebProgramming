BrowserStack works well. Interface is a little sluggish and switching between browsers / OSs is a little slow but over all excellent service.
Rolled back snapshot. If want to use browserstack with a local pipeline will need to reinstall java and javaFX

Notes from quick testing
Chrome
  Hit key to start editing and the key is doubled ie type "Smity" it enters edit mode ok but get "SSmith"
  hit space abr to enter edit in a pick list and it jumps unless its the last row

Opera train wreck
  after refresh looks ok
  lots of errors in dragonfly about invalid attributes

Safari
  Same 2 issues as Chrome
  The hilighted cell in grid looks odd in zebra striping. Out line of active indication is messed up every other row

On some tests the grid data was visible without scroll (all but firefox?)

Opera 11.6 supports ES5
