using git powershell interface
==============================

  need to cd to dir that holds repo

  git status
    shows current status eg
      # On branch master
      # Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      #   (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
      #
      nothing to commit, working directory clean

  git pull
    merge changes into local repository eg
      Updating ddfc804..9ab547c
      Fast-forward
       client/app/BMNext.sublime-workspace                | 104 ++++++++++++++-------

       5 files changed, 97 insertions(+), 51 deletions(-)

  git clone
    cd to parent dir
    run get clone. makes a new dir with the repo name
    eg to create repo in note/WebProgramming
    cd to notes
    type:
      git clone git@github.com:LunaticHowl/WebProgramming.git
    Creates new sub-dir (WebProgramming) with repo

if you use the windows app it to clone a repo it will be put in the default dir which is user...documents
you can set the default dir but not sure if you can force the windows app to prompt for dir where to put repo

commit and push
  commit is local only and commits changes to the local branch
  push actually updates the repo on Github
    git commit
      git commit --allow-empty-message
    or
      git commit -m"some msg here"
    or
      git commit -a -m"some msg here"

    git push

git commit -a will add/remove files automatically so you dont need to do "git add" and or "get rm"

To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked, use git rm --cached
This removes the file from the repo to stop watching the files use the .gitignore file
  eg
    git rm --cached client/app/BMNext.sublime-workspace

  tracked or untracked files
